msgid ""
"In Deno there is no concept of a package manager as external modules are "
"imported directly into local modules. This raises the question of how to "
"manage remote dependencies without a package manager. In big projects with "
"many dependencies it will become cumbersome and time consuming to update "
"modules if they are all imported individually into individual modules."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: docs/examples/manage_dependencies.md:27
msgid ""
"The standard practice for solving this problem in Deno is to create a `deps."
"ts` file. All required remote dependencies are referenced in this file and "
"the required methods and classes are re-exported. The dependent local "
"modules then reference the `deps.ts` rather than the remote dependencies. If "
"now for example one remote dependency is used in several files, upgrading to "
"a new version of this remote dependency is much simpler as this can be done "
"just within `deps.ts`."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"With all dependencies centralized in `deps.ts`, managing these becomes "
"easier.  Dev dependencies can also be managed in a separate `dev_deps.ts` "
"file, allowing clean separation between dev only and production dependencies."
