"Deno supports both JavaScript and TypeScript as first class languages at "
"runtime. This means it requires fully qualified module names, including the "
"extension (or a server providing the correct media type). In addition, Deno "
"has no \"magical\" module resolution. Instead, imported modules are "
"specified as files (including extensions) or fully qualified URL "
"imports. Typescript modules can be directly imported. E.g."

"When using `deno run`, `deno test`, `deno cache`, or `deno bundle` you can "
"specify the `--no-check` flag to disable TypeScript type checking. This can "
"significantly reduce the time that program startup takes. This can be very "
"useful when type checking is provided by your editor and you want startup "
"time to be as fast as possible (for example when restarting the program "
"automatically with a file watcher)."

msgid ""
"Because `--no-check` does not do TypeScript type checking we can not "
"automatically remove type only imports and exports as this would require "
"type information. For this purpose TypeScript provides the [`import type` "
"and `export type` "
"syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-exports).  "
"To export a type in a different file use `export type { AnInterface } from "
"\"./mod.ts\";`. To import a type use `import type { AnInterface } from "
"\"./mod.ts\";`. You can check that you are using `import type` and `export "
"type` where necessary by setting the `isolatedModules` TypeScript compiler "
"option to `true`, and the `importsNotUsedAsValues` to `error`. You can see "
"an example `tsconfig.json` with this option [in the standard "
"library](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/$CLI_VERSION/std/tsconfig_test.json).  "
"These settings will be enabled by default in the future. They are already "
"the default in Deno 1.4 or above when using `--unstable`."

"If you are importing a JavaScript module, and you know where the type "
"definition for that module is located, you can specify the type definition "
"at import. This takes the form of a compiler hint. Compiler hints inform "
"Deno the location of `.d.ts` files and the JavaScript code that is imported "
"that they relate to. The hint is `@deno-types` and when specified the value "
"will be used in the compiler instead of the JavaScript module. For example, "
"if you had `foo.js`, but you know that alongside of it was `foo.d.ts` which "
"was the types for the file, the code would look like this:"

"The hint affects the next `import` statement (or `export ... from` "
"statement)  where the value of the `@deno-types` will be substituted at "
"compile time instead of the specified module. Like in the above example, the "
"Deno compiler will load `./foo.d.ts` instead of `./foo.js`. Deno will still "

"`./node_modules/@types/node/index.d.ts`. Since this depends on non-relative "
